# Fourth AI Generated Silicon Challenge on ChipIgnite

The [challenge](https://efabless.com/genai/challenges/4) aims to leverage generative AI to develop an open-source hardware accelerator designed explicitly for _Keyword Spotting_ (KWS) applications on the Caravel System-on-Chip.

Utilize\ing generative AI to optimize the KWS machine learning model and/or the audio features extractor (e.g., MFCC) to create an energy-efficient KWS accelerator that seamlessly integrates into the Caravel SoC environment.
